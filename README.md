# Library-for-Cryptography
Building a small security library, compatible with the resources of the Internet of Things, while integrating the ins and outs of security in this field.


The different stages of the constitution of the library :

I. A short introduction to security for IoT
II. A first symmetrical encryption algorithm
III. Constitution of a random generator
IV. How to efficiently calculate a power
V. Generation of prime numbers
VI. Key exchange
VII. Asymmetric encryption algorithms:
  1. RSA
  2. El Gamal:
     - on the field of integers modulo p,
     - on elliptic curves.
  3. Blum-Goldwasser cryptosystem
