When we develop techniques for protecting and securing digital data, we have to make sure the adversary has no way of breaching it. Thus, probability and complexity play an important role in cryptography.\n",

    "    - the true random numbers, produced materially by the sensors, not reproducible, will be used to generate these encryption keys.\n",

    "Let's start first by illustrating these remarks, by presenting the symmetrical encryption known as one-time pad. In cryptography, the one-time pad (OTP) is an encryption technique that cannot be cracked, but requires the use of a single-use pre-shared key that is no smaller than the message being sent. In this technique, a plaintext is paired with a random secret key (also referred to as a one-time pad). Then, each bit or character of the plaintext is encrypted by combining it with the corresponding bit or character from the pad using modular addition."
